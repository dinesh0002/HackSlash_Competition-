WILDCARD ENTRY - TECH USED DEEP LEARNING

### Gitam HACKSLASH-HACKATHON COMPETITION 

This python notebook is on CYCLE GAN the architecture is given as follows

![cycle gan architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47123679/108616494-c4de7700-7433-11eb-8d60-f7eefa2a8e58.png)

The input to the following neural network is taken from MNIST dataset and the input is rotated into 90 degrees towards right and the output which we get is an initial image without any rotation.

Here we have two networks known as Generator and Discriminator where the Generator generated the images with an fake image and the Discriminator tries to realizes the images into True or False.

Here no of epoches are 1,00,000

This is made to run on Google Colab

As you can see the output in the final cell in the notebook as the output we get is the initial image without any rotation as the neural network is successfully able to generate image with rotated image given as input

Applications of Cycle GAN are :

-> Summer to Winter

-> Labels to street scene

-> Labels to realistic image 

-> black and white photo to color photo

Tried to get the output but i dont know wheather its the version problem or should i try other way around
