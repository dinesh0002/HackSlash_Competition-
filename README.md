The input to the following neural network is taken from MNIST dataset and the input is rotated into 90 degrees towards and right and the output which we get is an initial image without any rotation.

Here we have two networks known as Generator and Discriminator where the Generator generated the images with an fake image and the Discriminator tries to realizes the images into True or False.
